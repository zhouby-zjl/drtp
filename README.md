# The Source Code of the Resilient Sensor Data Dissemination Mechanism (RSDD) Implementing the Disruption Resilient Transport Protocol (DRTP) for Power Transmission Grids

## What are the RSDD and DRTP? 
In todayâ€™s power transmission grids, Internet-of-Things networks employ long-haul optical wires for regular sensor data dissemination to a server. Ensuring resilience against link faults is paramount to observe the grid states accurately via a process known as state estimation (SE). The accuracy is achieved by minimizing the end-to-end failure rate in packet delivery (EEFR). Current approaches focus on hop-by-hop retransmission control with in-path caching. Notably, the disruption-resilient transport protocol (DRTP) stands out for achieving the lowest EEFR. DRTP employs robust hop-by-hop retransmission and a recursive collaboration process guided by arrival timeouts. However, challenges arise in maintaining recursiveness with timeouts, leading to increased EEFR due to cache mismatch. These intensify when a hop triggers arrival timeouts, spawning retransmission instances in an unexpected sequence, which can experience an unprotected parallel race condition. To address this, we propose RSDD, a resilient mechanism for sensor data dissemination for implementing DRTP in the correct and fully verified manner. RSDD orchestrates concurrent retransmission instances, ensuring exclusive execution for the same lost packet, precisely scheduled based on timeouts. We evaluated the performance of RSDD in a simulated network that combines SE and a grid, using ndnSIM, MATPOWER, and RTDS. The results validate RSDD as a correct DRTP implementation, highlighting its exclusiveness and quality-of-service performance. RSDD achieves an EEFR of 2.44% and an average end-to-end packet delivery time (EEDT) of 2.7 ms during full path disruption with a 20% link loss rate in packets. Moreover, RSDD excels in enabling SE to maintain the grid observability and accuracy. 

## How do I run the source code?
1. You need to download both the DRTP from github and the recent ndnSIM from https://ndnsim.net/current/. 
2. Simply copy all files of the DRTP to the ndnSIM folder in an override manner. 
3. You need to edit the drtp-config-static.ini file under the ndnSIM/ns-3 folder with the correct IEEE bus dataset path, the output log path and some simulation parameters. 
4. Run DRTP testers. First, cd ndnSIM/ns-3. Second, there are the tester with the route algorithms available below:
   - A Dijkstra based algorithm to generate multi-path subgraph (GenMPSG). You can run: ./waf --run scratch/drtp-sim-static-dijkstra --command-template="%s drtp-config-dijkstra.ini". 
5. Afterwards, you can find the simulation results under the SIM_LOG_DIR directory defined in the above ini file.
